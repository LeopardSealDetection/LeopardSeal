# LeopardSeal
Artifacts for the paper "LeopardSeal: Detecting Call Interception via Audio Rogue Base Stations" presented at MobiSys 2023

## Hardware Requirements ##
To fully recreate our study, you need three main components: (1) an Audio Rouge Base Station (ARBS), (2) an audio loopback device, and (3) an audio measurement device. Our ARBS consists of consumer products interfaced with USB and ethernet cables to a host computer, while our embedded audio devices require connections to be made through wires and breadboards or soldered connections. 

## Instructions ##
We provide two directories (```ARBS``` and ```audio_devices```) which contain instructions for purchasing hardware requirements, downloading software, and running the code necessary to recreate our study on ARBS detection.
